# fortrabbit help pages

Welcome to the source of the official fortrabbit documentation. These files here are written in Markdown, with a little frontmatter meta-data on top. We include this repo as a Git subtree and publish it on: https://help.fortrabbit.com

This repo lives under (clone URL):

* git@github.com:fortrabbit/help.git


## Contributing

Found a typo or an error? Do you want to add something about your framework or service of choice? You are more than welcome to contribute. Please send us a Pull Request.

Do you run a 3rd party service or an open source project that can be integrated with fortrabbit? You are also more than welcome to add it.


### _WIP

The folder _WIP contains — as you might can guess — work in progress. All infos in there are subject to major errors. Please contribute!



### File name conventions

* use dashes instead of spaces or lowdashes for filen ames
* use the short versions: `-uni`, `-pro` on the end for different stacks



### Front Matter syntax

Each markdown file requires a yaml block at the top. See here which attributes are available, how and when to use them.

```yaml
# Rendering

template: article



# Headline & display

# lead text for article detail view -> what to expect from content
lead: Forget servers. Think services instead. Learn the basic fortrabbit concepts.

# alternative to lead text. when lead is intro & excerpt is overview or lead is not available
excerpt: Get to know about the basic concepts.

## Horizontal rulers

* `---` don't use this, otherwise the whole help page won't be rendered
* `- - -` use this


## Dynamic help

Those values will be replaced by JS when users are logged in:

```
SSH user: {{ssh-user}}
Region:   {{region}}
Your app: {{app-name}}
```

It will dynamically show the correct code examples and Dashboard links.


## Dashboard links

You can have certain parts in Markdown available only for Users who are logged in like so:

```
<div markdown="1" data-user="known">

[Set up a new domain for your App {{app-name}}](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com/apps/{{app-name}}/domains/new/name)

</div>
```

This parses markdown inside the DIV. With the data-user attribute it checks if the user is logged in. links to the Dashboard will be styled as buttons — use a verb to start them!


## Code examples

* try to keep code examples together in one block, avoid mixing paragraphs and code blocks

### Bash

* each command should have
* show output only when necessary
* output should be a comment
* `$` to start a command

### PHP

* when there is code between use: `other code …`


## Install guide skeleton

* file name: `install-wordpress-uni`
* Dashboard settings first
* Mini guide in the middle > time to WOW
* Migration/Tuning after that


## Writing help & blog articles

* Don't bullshit. Avoid the use of marketing buzzwords.
* Avoid "eg", otherwise choose one style to write it
* Keep lists readable (no sublists, etc).
* available headlines in text: h2, h3, h4, please don't go deeper.
* Text structure is important, but readability is even more important.
* Use ASCII art to illustrate topographies and such things.
* code blocks follow standard markdown formatting.
* Use sentence case in headlines.
* Don't use too many headlines to structure text.
* Don't use italic > it looks ugly, it's rendered by the browser not the font.
* Start code examples right away: PHP without "<?php", Bash without "$"
* Don't use a paragraph for every sentence.
* Write speaking links, not like so: `[here](http://somewhere)` but so: `[GitHub project](http…)`

## Maintainability

Find the right balance between being general and being precise (aka Captain Obvious). Very detailed step-by-step articles are easy to follow but get outdated very quickly. Don't "bury" numbers (like prices and limits) in articles. All those numbers must be managed in the "pricing" and the "specs" page.

Keep it DRY! Don't repeat yourself. Don't cover the same topic on different places. Just link to the location where it best suits. 

## Link checking

This example shows how to use the linkcheck command line tool (not included here) for macOS:

```
$ mv linkcheck.mac /usr/local/bin
$ chmod +x linkcheck.mac
$ linkcheck.mac --url http://help.fortrabbit.dev
```

## Avoid words list

please do not use the following "bullshit" words:

* great
* awesome
* innovative
* game-changing
* empowering
* revolutionizing


## Gender-neutral language

When referencing a hypothetical person, such as "a user with a session cookie", use gender-neutral pronouns (they/their/them). For example, instead of:

* he or she, use they
* him or her, use them
* his or her, use their
* his or hers, use theirs
* himself or herself, use themselves


## Corporate identity

There is no fortrabbit logo as graphic file. To create the brand logo just type: "• fortrabbit" — bullet character, a normal space and then name of the company with a f. Use the [Georgia Typeface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)) in bold and italic. Use lot's of whitespace around the logo, don't put other text nearby the logo. When using the company name within a paragraph of text, write "fortrabbit" with a f, even at the beginning of a sentence. Don't use the bullet or any other typeface here.


### Logos and brand assets

Place logos for external services and projects in the media folder. They ideally should be svg or either PNG with transparent background. Favor an "image mark" over a "word image mark".
