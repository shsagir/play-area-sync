## Inviting a client

1. Login to the fortrabbit [Dashboard](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com)
2. Make sure you have set up your first/last name in the Dashboard
2. Click on "Invite a client"
3. Follow the steps to send an invitation
4. Your client will receive the payment request
5. Your client will sign-up (or login)
6. Your client will complete the billing
7. You are now Admin of your clients Company

Your client will not be bothered with setting up SSH keys, nor will hir receive geeky newsletters. The client can login to the Dashboard to manage billing and team.

### The 35 seconds video

</div>

In this video you see how both sides of the invite look like. What you need to do, and what your client will see.

### Invitation details

Client invitation also works with Apps in trial mode. This is super handy, as you don't need to enter your personal billing data at all. Mind that all client invites expire after a short time frame.

## Working for the client

As an Admin you will see the App your client in the Dashboard. You can of course access code and change settings and scaling in the Dashboard. You can also book additional Apps on behalf of the clients Company and invite others.

## Quitting the client relation

1. In the Dashboard
2. Go to the Company of your client
3. Click on "Leave Company"
4. Read and confirm

The client can also dismiss you of your access role within hir Company.

## Alternative work-flows

#### You manage the clients business

1. Login to the Dashboard
1. Click on "[Set up a new Company](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com//account/company/new)" and follows the steps
2. Use the billing informations provided by your client
3. Changes the "Invoice e-mail" address to the client e-mail

This work-flow is faster and does not involve any interaction from the client at all. It is however not so clean as the the developer needs to have access to confidential credit card informations.
