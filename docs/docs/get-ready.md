## Create an App

We assume you've already created an [App](/app) with fortrabbit. If not: Do so in the [fortrabbit Dashboard](/dashboard). When you have your App ready at fortrabbit and you are currently logged in the Dashboard, the help pages here will show you [live code examples](access-methods#toc-the-code-example-helper) matching the settings for your individual App, so you can easily copy/paste them.

#### Choose your software

While creating the App we are showing you a list of popular frameworks and CMS, this is called the [Software Preset](app#toc-software-preset). Choose the one you want, or any PHP App. That will pre-configure the fortrabbit App, but not install any software. You can change that later on.

## Run a local web server with PHP

You have a PHP development environment with Apache, MySQL, PHP and Git setup and running on your local machine, haven't you? This is crucial, we advice to have a local development environment for all kind of projects. All install guides are written with a local development environment in mind. Find more details on how to do that in our [local development guide](local-development).
