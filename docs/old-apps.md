<!-- TODO: recheck! -->

We have three generations of Apps/Stacks here on fortrabbit: 

* Old Apps (2013 - ~2017?)
* Professional Stack (from 2015 on) < formaly known as New App
* Universal Stack (from 2016 on)

This article lists resources to still work with the Old Apps.


## Deprecation warning

Please be warned that the Old Apps are currently phasing out. We recommend not create any new Old App any more. Old Apps are in sun set phase.


## Persistent storage and runtime data

While New Apps have ephemeral storage, Old Apps have a **persistent storage** with access via [SSH](ssh-sftp-old) and permanent write access on the file system.
