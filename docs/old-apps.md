We have three generations of Apps/Stacks here on fortrabbit: 

* Old Apps (2013 - ~2017?)
* Professional Stack (from 2015 on) < formaly known as New App

## Deprecation warning

Please be warned that the Old Apps are currently phasing out. We recommend not create any new Old App any more. Old Apps are in sun set phase.


## Persistent storage and runtime data

While New Apps have ephemeral storage, Old Apps have a **persistent storage** with access via [SSH](ssh-sftp-old-app) and permanent write access on the file system.
