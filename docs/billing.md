This article is all about the concepts of billing, pricing, payments, invoices & taxes. Please also check out the [Billing Contact](company#toc-billing-contacts) section of the Company article to learn about practical usage in the Dashboard.


### Free trial

You can test fortrabbit before you pay a dime. All you need to do is: sign up to fortrabbit and try it for free.  Of course: You don't need to opt-out, but you can, of course, opt-in.

### Consumption based billing

Pay after usage: No upfront costs nor payment! **First you book, then you'll use it, then we'll invoice you** for what you have actually used.

We get a few e-mails each month after invoicing. People are confused why they still see Apps on the invoice that have been deleted. Usually you pay upfront for stuff you book online. You want something, you pay for it. fortrabbit has a consumption based billing. That means we charge AFTER usage. Just like with your old telephone bill. At the end of the month you'll get an invoice for what you have used in that month. So, when you start using an App on the 15th of Jan, you'll be invoiced at the end of Jan for using the App for half a month. So at the start of each month you'll get an invoice for the stuff you have booked last month. Also look at the invoice period.


### Account cancellation

**You can always quit**. Scale down or kill certain Apps or even cancel your Account completely.

We will delete all your Account data. But it is required by law to keep your billing related data, that is basically the invoices and infos around it. The same applies to your credit card informations, but those are stored with our credit card service vendor — not with us.


### Monthly invoices

Within the first days of every new month you will get the invoice for your last month's consumption. As there are no upfront payments (yet), yearly payment is not (yet) supported.

### Daily billing cycle

When you book something on the 16th day of a month and the month has 30 days you only pay for the 15 days you're using the product. The minimum billing period is one day. For paid support this rule does not apply!

### Costs monitoring

You can see a live preview of your usage for the current month. Log in to the Dashboard > Billing Contact. There you'll find a cost preview for the ongoing month, covering all of your Apps. This overview shows you what will be printed on the next invoice. Please mind that it will show the current costs of the day of the month so far.


### Payment methods

You can pay by **credit card** (Visa & Master, no debit cards) or **SEPA direct debit** (EU clients only). For "enterprise clients" (large volume) we also offer to pay by **bill** (on account, after invoice).

### Billing e-mail address

You can setup a different e-mail address for each [Billing Contact](/company#toc-billing-contacts).

### Taxes

fortrabbit is a B2B hosting solution, it's for entrepreneurs only, we expect you to use it professionally. While that can mean anything and nothing it has some fiscal implications:

* Our prices are shown as net prices without Value Added Tax (VAT).
* If you are a non-VAT registered company in a EU country, we add VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in a EU country and add your valid VAT IN, we don't charge you VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in Germany, we add VAT, but you will get it back from your tax-office.
* If you are a company from a NON-EU country, we don't charge you VAT.

### VAT-IN from clients in EU countries

We recommend to enter your VAT-IN with your Billing Contact. This way you save upfront costs for VAT — reverse charge makes this possible.


### Currencies

All [Billing Contacts](/company#toc-billing-contacts) within the EU are required to pay in EUR. Billing Contacts from other countries can choose rather they like to be charged in USD or EUR. It is not possible to change the currency of a Billing Contact later on. But you can: create a new Billing Contact with a different currency and then move Apps there. Please mind that customers from the EU have to pay in EUR.


### Pending transaction

When you create a Billing Contact, we'll do a debit test on your credit card, when you enter the informations with us. This should not show up on your credit card statements, as it just a test. We have heard from clients that it sometimes shows up. Please don't worry, it will not be processed.


### Downloading previous invoices

**Option 1**: Scan your e-mail inbox for mails with the subject "fortrabbit invoice" for the monthly invoices we have sent you. Each e-mail contains a secret link to the invoice. From there you can print/download.

**Option 2**: "Download/print" invoices from the [Dashboard](/dashboard): Login to the Dashboard > Your Account > Companies (Your Company) > Billing Contact > Invoice archive > Invoice > print.

Invoices are shown as HTML > you can use print from the browser to generate and download a nicely styled PDF.



### Open invoices

You can pay your open invoices in the Dashboard yourself like so: Login to the Dashboard > follow the instructions on the "open invoices" warning. Credit card payments are done "live". SEPA direct payments are delayed. When your credit card didn't had enough balance at first, we might try again during the month.

Please contact us when you are aware that you habe open invoices with us. Otherwise we might delete your Apps. See [this story](https://blog.fortrabbit.com/bounced-payment).


#### Not enough credits

Your payment bounces — which costs us a lot of money each month. We might pass those costs to you — the client. We will inform you about bounced payments. We also try to debit again. Multiple bounced invoices will result in service cancelation.


#### Expired credit cards

We will inform you about the bounced invoice. Please add your new credit card details to your Billing Contact.
