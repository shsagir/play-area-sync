## Problem

Data loss is something, which can happen to everybody: be it an unpatched security whole in your underlying CMS or be it the overworked content editor, who accidentally deletes rather important data. Whatever the cause, you should have backups to recover in case of disaster. Backups are notoriously underused, because it can be hard to set them up properly and also hard to monitor them continuously, to guarantee that they are there, when needed.

## Solution

Automatic, out-of-the box, off-site, encrypted daily backups, without configuration and without hassle.

## Access backups

You can find your App's backups in the Dashboard > Your App > Backups. We automatically generate two backup files per day: One of your App's web storage and one of your App's MySQL storage.

### Backup availability

Depending on the region your App runs in, the daily backups will become available at around:

* **EU**: 05:00h GMT (05:00h UTC)
* **US**: 05:00h EST (10:00h UTC)

All backups are generated from snapshots, which are taken at 02:00h in the respective time zone.

If you need backups available for a longer time period than the retention time allows (see [Specs](https://www.fortrabbit.com/specs)), then we recommend to periodically download the backups from the dashboard and store them locally.

## Recover from backups

As mentioned above, there are two types of backups: MySQL and Web storage. Here is how you recover from either:

### Recover from MySQL backups

The MySQL backup file is a regular MySQL dump, generated by the `mysqldump` tool. You can recover from it the same way you would (re-)import MySQL data into your database. Please read on [in the MySQL import/export guide](mysql#toc-export-amp-import).

### Recover from Web storage backups

Web storage backups are stored in an uncompressed `.tar` archive file. How to recover your web storage data, depends on what you want to recover: Just a single file, a couple of files or everything?

**Recover a single or a couple of files**: Just download the web storage backup file, unpack it locally, copy the files you want to recover manually to back to your App.

**Recover everything**: After downloading and unpacking the web storage `.tar` archive locally, you need to remove all files from your current App, then upload the previously unpacked archive again. **Note**: All changes (i.e. file uploads) in between the backup and you uploading it will be removed that way.
