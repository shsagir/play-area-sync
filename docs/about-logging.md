fortrabbit provides [access to live logs](/logging), but currently no access to historic logs. Historic log providers are about more than just simply viewing the raw log data. They are about analyzing logs in a way which helps you understand what is going on. They help you to get insight into your App's behavior and even allow you to detect negative trends before they can take effect.
