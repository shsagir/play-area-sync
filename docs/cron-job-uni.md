## Use cases

**Database maintenance**: say the web application cumulates data which needs to be transformed and/or wiped periodically. A Cron Job allows you to make sure the `app/console db:cleanup` - or whatever - script executes hourly, daily, weekly or whenever your want.

**Cache clearing**: say the web application has a news site, which homepage must be rebuilt every ten minutes or so. With a Cron Job you can schedule a cleanup of the homepage every one, ten, thirty or whatever minutes required.


## Availabilty

Cron Jobs are only available for certain App plans. Please see the [plans & pricing page](https://www.fortrabbit.com/pricing) for more.

## Usage

You can configure your App's Cron Job in the Dashboard > {{app-name}} > Settings > Cron Jobs. To start a new Cron Job you'll need the set the following parameters:

### Name

A unique name, so the job can be identified later on in the logs or statistics.

### Command

The PHP command which shall be executed, eg `app/console db:cleanup` or `path/to/my-script.php`

### Interval

The interval at which you want to execute the job.

1. every minute
2. every 10 minutes
2. every 30 minutes
3. every hour
4. every day
5. every week
6. every month

The interval timing is guaranteed, the exact time of execution is randomized. For example: 30 minutes will run at every 13th minute and at the 43rd minute again. All daily, weekly and monthly jobs run between 00:00 and 10:00 UTC. Weekly intervals will run on Monday.

## Logging

All output generated by Cron Jobs can be accessed via [log files](logging-uni#toc-log-file-access) and [live logs](logging-uni#toc-live-log-access).

## Alternatives

Universal Apps support a single Cron Job per App with limited resources. Professional Apps come with the [Worker Component](worker-pro), which offers dedicated resources, multiple Cron Jobs per App and additionally Nonstop Jobs, which are persistently running background workers.
